IPv4 addresses are seperates into 4 octets of 8 bits each 
Each octet is seperated by decimal points in a format called dotted decimal notation
[Insert image like what they have]

An IP address can be of six different "classes" class A through E and classes
The class of an IP address is determined by how many ones lead the first octect

Binary   |Range       |Class  
---------|------------|-------
0xxxxxxx |   0 -> 126 |   A   
10xxxxxx | 128 -> 191 |   B   
110xxxxx | 192 -> 223 |   C   
1110xxxx | 224 -> 239 |   D (Multicasting)
1111xxxx | 240 -> 255 |   E (Research)
(x's represent 1 or 0)

Notice how 127 is not able to be used according to our chart
That is because 127.x.x.x (X's represent 0 to 255) is reserved for loopback

Say we have an ip address such as 192.168.0.1 which in binary looks like 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001
We isolate the first 8 bits and see that 11000000 looks like class c's 110xxxxx so our 192.168.0.1 IP is a class C address

Now that we know our class we can determine how many network and host octets we have
A network octet is an octet that within your network is unchangeable without switching to another network
A host octet is an octect that can be changed within an network to asign IP addresses to devices

 Class | Network/Host Octets | Number of Hosts
-------|---------------------|---------------------
   A   |  N.H.H.H            | 16,777,214
   B   |  N.N.H.H            | 65,534
   C   |  N.N.N.H            | 254
   D   |  N/A                |
   E   |  N/A                |
(H represents host octets while N represents network octets)

In order to get our number of hosts we take 256 to the power of however many octets are host octets minus two
For example our IP 192.168.0.1 in class C has one host octet
Therefore our number of hosts is 256^1 - 2 which is 254 like in the chart above

The reason we subract 2 from our number of hosts is that the very first and very last IP in the class are reserved
The reserved IP at the beginning of our 192.168.0.1 IP would be 192.168.0.0 and that is our network address
Now to get our second reserved IP we turn every host octet 255 so for our IP that would make it 192.168.0.255
This IP is our broadcast address which is what all devices on the network listen to to get information thats for all of them

With that we've gotten all of the info needed for a network

We have our IPs class, network address and broadcast address
To assign IPs to your network you just have to make sure that the IPs fall between your network address and broadcast address

Now there are private and public IP addresses we need to worry about

IP Address Range        | Purpose
------------------------|--------------------------------
10.x.x.x                | Large organization private IPs
172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x | Loopback and private routing
192.168.x.x             | Private networks like at home
(x's represent 0 to 255)

These IPs have been introduced over the years in order to extend the lifespan of the IPv4 address scheme
While its worked great IPv4 has largely been phased out of the civilian world for IPv6
